            <h2><b>The Overview</b></h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;I created a carousel to display art pieces to viewers for <a href="http://reiddumont.com/portfolio.html" target="blank">my portfolio website</a>. The carousel was designed to improve user experience by displaying art pieces larger and more prominently for users. I did this using HTML, CSS, and JS. The project was completed in ten weeks. The project is deemed successful as the carousel is able to display images with their captions correctly at a good resolution and a user can navigate easily.

        <div class="background">
            <h2><b>Background/Description/Timeline/Purpose</b></h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;I was given the task of creating a micro-interaction to improve a website’s user experience. I looked at areas where I could improve my existing portfolio website and came up with the idea of a carousel to display art pieces/projects I have worked on. I felt this would improve the UX as it would present my pieces better than the tile setup that is currently implemented. The project was given ten weeks to complete. This project can be defined as successful if the carousel is able to display images with their captions correctly at a good resolution and a user can navigate easily.

            <h2><b>Process and Insight</b></h2>
            <p>
                &emsp;After thinking up the carousel idea my first design process consisted of an analysis of all the pieces that made up the micro-interaction. After analyzing the triggers, rules, feedback, and loops+modes, I moved to photoshop to mock up what I wanted the final carousel to look like.<br> <br>

            </p>
            <p>
                &emsp;The next step was to begin coding. I found multiple tutorials on creating carousels online and followed them to build the final in HTML, CSS, and JS. I had some issues containing the images to be all the same size so this prompted me to resize the images in photoshop to match the container. I applied the black background to the text last to make sure the image titles were readable no matter the background.

                &emsp;The completed interaction is a great hero piece for viewers who first enter my website. I feel users will be inclined to click through and view these high resolutions pieces. Later I would like to combine this carousel with a lightbox feature so users can view the uncropped images in the carousel or link straight to my project pages.

                &emsp;This project is a success. It achieves what I set out to do and is even modular so I can add more images or change the images later. This will improve the presentation on my website and make it easier for users to see my work at a glance. In the future, I’d like to make it so I don’t have to crop my images before implementing it into the carousel to make adding images to display even easier.
